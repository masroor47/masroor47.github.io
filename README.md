#Welcome to my new project!

Here I will learn web development and stuff

---

##HTML
I will start learning basic html pages with plain structure like this:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

##CSS
We can make that basic page a tiny bit prettier with cascading style sheets:

```
h1 {
    color: red;
    font-family: courier;
    font-size: 60px;
}
```
And that's about it for now.
